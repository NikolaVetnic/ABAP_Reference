## ABAP Development Tools (for Eclipse)

When you use ADT, you log on to an SAP back-end system and work directly with its repository objects - the development process is exactly the same as when you use the *ABAP Workbench*.

An ABAP project serves as a container for the development objects that are stored in a particular ABAP back-end system, and contains the logon parameters for the system logon â€” System, Client, User, and language. To make it easier to manage objects you can set up favorite packages for each project.

Types of editors:
* native Eclipse editors
	* Eclipse features
	* Eclipse-like look and feel
	* available for some Repository Objects (e.g. Programs, Classes, Web Dynpro, etc.)
* integrated SAP GUI editors
	* no new features
	* SAP GUI look and feel
	* used where no native editor is available (e.g. Transactions, Dictionary Objects, Screens, etc.)
