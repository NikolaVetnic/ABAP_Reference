## Global Classes

Local classes and interfaces are used only within the program in which they are defined and implemented. The `CLASS` statement is a local declarative statement in the program. As the `TYPES` statement defines local data types, the `CLASS` statement defines local object types.

Global classes or global interfaces are individual repository objects with all the standard ABAP Workbench features such as active integration, versioning, transport system. The namespace convention, for example `Y*`, `Z*`, or a special customer namespace is the same as that name used for the namespace of other repository objects.

A special maintenance tool is available in the ABAP Workbench, which is the **Class Builder**.
