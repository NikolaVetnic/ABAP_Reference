## Unit 1

1. What are the three types of literals? **Answer:** Numeric literals, text field literals, string literals.

2. A `DATA` statement defines a local data object in the method if it appears between which statements? **Answer:** `METHOD ... ENDMETHOD.`

3. Open SQL statements allow the ABAP programmer uniform access to data, regardless of the database system installed. **Answer:** true.

# In More Detail...

## Unit 1

The ABAP runtime environment differentiates among the following types of literals: Numeric literals, Text field literals, String literals. Read more in the lesson, Using ABAP Data Types and Data Objects, Task: Literals, in the course BC402 (Unit 1, Lesson 2) or TAW11e (Unit 1, Lesson 1).

If the DATA statement appears within METHOD..ENDMETHOD, it defines a local data object in the method. Read more in the lesson, Using ABAP Data Types and Data Objects, Task: Visibility of Data Objects in Object-Oriented ABAP, in the course BC402 (Unit 1, Lesson 2) or TAW11e. (Unit 1, Lesson 1).

Open SQL statements are a subset of Standard SQL that is fully integrated in the ABAP language. Open SQL statements allow uniform data access to the ABAP programmer regardless of the database system installed. The database interface dynamically converts Open SQL statements to database-specific SQL statements. For more information, see Unit 1 Lesson 3: Selecting Data from a Single Database Table with Open SQL Task Open SQL Architecture.
