### In More Detail...

#### Unit 1

The procedural programming model allows separation of data and functions. In an ABAP, procedural program, global variables contain data, while subroutines contain functions. Read more in the task, The Procedural Programming Model, in the lesson, Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, in course BC401.

You are correct! Multiple Instantiation is the possibility to create several runtime instances using the same program context. It is one of the key characteristics of object-oriented programming. Read more in the task, Multiple Instantiation in Object-Oriented Programming, in the lesson, Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, in course BC401.

Unlike in procedural programming, using multiple instantiation in object- oriented programming allows you to create a direct abstraction of a real object. Objects are a direct abstraction of the real world. Read more in the task, Object-Oriented ABAP, in the lesson, Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, in the course, BC401.

The different diagram types in UML represent different views of a system. Behavior diagrams show the sequence in which the objects relate to each other. Read more in the task, Class Diagrams, in the lesson, Analyzing and Designing with Unified Modeling Language (UML), in the course, BC401.

Object-oriented programming views the real world as a collection of objects. Some of these objects are similar and can be described in the same way if they use the same characteristics and exhibit the same behavior. You can group all the characteristics and behaviors of these similar objects into one central class. Read more in the task, Classification of Objects, in the lesson, Analyzing and Designing with Unified Modeling Language (UML), in the course, BC401.

#### Unit 2

One of the characteristics of a class in object-oriented programming is that a class statement cannot be nested; that is, you cannot define a class within a class. However, you can define local auxiliary classes for global classes. Read more in this lesson, Creating Local Classes, Task Characteristics of a Class, in the course, BC401.

**Static attributes** exist once for each class and are visible for all runtime instances in that class. You define static attributes with the syntax element, CLASS-DATA. Read more in this lesson, Creating Local Classes, Task Static Attributes and Instance Attributes, in the course, BC401.

The `CREATE OBJECT` statement creates an object in the memory. The object attribute values are initial or assigned according to the `TYPE` specification. Read more in the task, Creating Objects, in the lesson, Creating Objects, in the course, BC401.

The reference variable can point to the instance of a class. The initial value of a reference variable is an empty reference, that is, the reference points to nothing at all. Read more in the task, Definition of Reference Variables, in the lesson, Creating Objects, in the course, BC401.

A class contains the generic description of an object and describes the characteristics that all objects in that class have in common. During the program runtime, you use the class to create discrete objects (instances) in the memory. This process is called instantiation. Read more in the task, Objects as Instances of Classes, in the lesson, Creating Objects, in the course BC401.

Static methods are addressed with their class name, since they do not need instances. When you call a static method from the class, you can omit the class name. Read more in the task, Static Method Calls, in the lesson, Accessing Methods and Attributes, in the course, BC401.

You can call functional methods within the following expressions: `MOVE`, `LOOP`, Logical expressions: `IF`, `ELSEIF`, `WHILE`, `CHECK`, `WAIT`, arithmetic expressions and bit expressions: `COMPUTE`, case conditions: `CASE`, `WHEN`. Read more in the task, Functional Method Calls, in the lesson, Accessing Methods and Attributes, in the course, BC401.

Methods that have a `RETURNING` parameter are described as functional methods. Read more in the task, Functional Method Calls, in the lesson, Accessing Methods and Attributes, in the course, BC401.

The `RETURNING` parameter must always be passed by value - `RETURNING VALUE(...)` - and not by reference. Read more in the task, Functional Method Calls, in the lesson, Accessing Methods and Attributes, in the course, BC401.

The instance constructor is a special instance method in a class and is always named `CONSTRUCTOR`. Read more in the task, Instance Constructor, in the lesson, Implementing Constructors in Local Classes, in the course, BC401.

The constructor is automatically called at runtime with the `CREATE OBJECT` statement. Read more in the task, Instance Constructor, in the lesson, Implementing Constructors in Local Classes, in the course, BC401.

When you define static constructors, always consider the following points: 
* each class does not have more than one static constructor
* the static constructor must be defined in the public section
* the static constructor does not have any parameters or exceptions
* the static constructor cannot be called explicitly. 
Read more in the task, Static Constructor of the lesson, Implementing Class Constructors in Local Classes, in course BC401.

The instance constructor signature can only include importing parameters and exceptions. Read more in the task, Static Constructor of the lesson, Implementing Class Constructors in Local Classes, in course BC401.

#### Unit 3

The common components of the subclasses only need to be defined and implemented in the superclass and they are inherited by all the subclasses. The subclasses are in turn different specializations of their superclasses. Therefore, additions (extensions) or changes are permitted in the subclasses. Read more in the task, Characteristics of Generalization and Specialization, in the lesson, Implementing Inheritance, in the course, BC401.

Inheritance must be used to implement generalization and specialization relationships. A superclass is a generalization of its subclasses. Read more in task, Implementation of Inheritance, in the lesson, Implementing Inheritance, of course BC401.

If you assign a subclass reference to a superclass reference, this subclass ensures that all components that you can access syntactically after the cast assignment are actually available in the instance. The subclass always contains at least the same components as the superclass always the name and the signature of redefined methods are identical. Read more in the task, Upcasts, in the lesson, Implementing Up-casts using Inheritance, of course BC401.

When objects of different classes react differently to the same method calls, this is known as polymorphism. A client can handle different classes uniformly, irrespective of their implementation. The runtime system searches for the right implementation of a method on behalf of the client. Read more in the lessons, Implementing Up-casts using Inheritance and Implementing Polymorphism Using Inheritance, of the course, BC401.

A typical use for up-cast assignments is to prepare for generic access. A user who is not interested in the finer points of the instances of the subclasses but simply needs to address the shared components can use a superclass reference for this access. Read more in the task, Generic Access to Objects, in the lesson, Implementing Polymorphism Using Inheritance, of the course, BC401.

To assign a superclass reference to a subclass reference, you must use the downcast assignment, also called narrowing cast. Read more in the task, Downcasts, in the lesson, Implementing Downcast Using Inheritance, of course BC401.

The downcast assignment operator is `MOVE ... ?TO ...` or its short form `?=`. Read more in the task, Downcasts, in the lesson, Implementing Downcast Using Inheritance, of course BC401.

After assigning a superclass type of reference to a subclass reference, clients are no longer limited to inherited components. Read more in the task, Downcasts, in the lesson, Implementing Downcast Using Inheritance, of course BC401.

Commonly used elements only need to be stored once in a central location (in the superclass). These elements are then automatically available to all subclasses. Changes made at a later stage have an immediate effect on the subclasses. Implementing Polyphormism using inheritance provides the generic access â€“ one call, multiple implementations. Read more in the task, Usage of Class Hierarchies, in the lesson, Implementing Downcast Using Inheritance, of course BC401.
