# In More Detail...

## Unit 1

Presentation Server layer is the highest layer. This layer contains the user interface where each user can access the program, enter new data, and receive the results of a work process. Read more in the section, ABAP System Architecture, in the lesson, Describing the Processing of ABAP Programs, in the course BC400 (Unit 1, Lesson 1) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 7, Lesson 1).

A program is not made up of a single block, but of several units. This is known as modularization. You can use most of these modularization units in more than one program. Therefore, they are often termed as reuse units. Read more in the section, Interplay Between Server Levels and Program Flow, in the lesson, Describing the Processing of ABAP Programs, in the course BC400 (Unit 1, Lesson 1) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 7, Lesson 1).

## Unit 2

The repository consists of all ABAP development objects, such as programs, function modules, and definitions of database tables. It contains objects delivered by SAP as well as those defined by the customer. Note that the terms repository object and development object are often used interchangeably. Read more in the section, ABAP Repository, in the lesson, Introducing the ABAP Workbench, in the course BC400 (Unit 2, Lesson 1) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 8, Lesson 1).

The ABAP Editor provides a range of functions, including editing the source code, syntax checks, and options for the capitalization of ABAP keywords. Read more in the section, ABAP Workbench Tools, in the lesson, Introducing the ABAP Workbench, in the course BC400 (Unit 2, Lesson 1) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 8, Lesson 1).

There are three package types: development package (can contain Repository objects and other packages), main package (can only contain other packages), and structure package (can only contain main packages). Read more in the section, Package Attributes, in the lesson, Organizing ABAP Development Projects, in the course BC400 (Unit 2, Lesson 2) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 8, Lesson 2).

When a developer completes the development project, the developer releases the corresponding task. This release transfers the objects in the task to the transport request. Once all team members release their tasks, the development leader can release the transport request, and the transport is triggered. Read more in the section, Closing of the Project by Releasing the Request (Project Manager), in the lesson, Finalizing ABAP Development Projects, in the course BC400 (Unit 2, Lesson 4) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 8, Lesson 4).

Whenever you create or change a development object and then save it, the system stores only one inactive version in the Repository. You have an active version and an inactive version of the object. When you complete object development, you have to activate the inactive version (editing version) of the object. This version becomes the new active version of the object. Read more in the section, Activation of Programs, in the lesson, Developing ABAP Programs, in the course BC400 (Unit 2, Lesson 3) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 8, Lesson 3).

The features of the ABAP programming language are as follows: It is typed, It enables multi-language application, It enables SQL access, It is enhanced as an object-oriented language, It is platform-independent, It is upward-compatible. Read more in the section, ABAP Programming Language Features, in the lesson, Developing ABAP Programs, in the course BC400 (Unit 2, Lesson 3) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 8, Lesson 3).

ABAP Objects is the object-oriented enhancement of the ABAP programming language. Read more in the lesson, Developing ABAP Programs, Task: ABAP Programming Language Features, in the course BC400 (Unit 2, Lesson 3) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 8, Lesson 3).

Lines that begin with an asterisk (`*`) in the first column are recognized as comment lines by the ABAP runtime system and are ignored. Read more in the lesson, Developing ABAP Programs, Task: General ABAP Syntax II, in the course BC400 (Unit 2, Lesson 3) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 8, Lesson 3).

When a development object is edited or created, the relevant employee assigns this to the change request. The object is entered into the task of the employee. All Repository objects that an employee works on during a development project are collected within the employeeâ€™s task. The task will be released by the employee when all assigned work is done. Read more in the lesson, Organizing ABAP Development Projects, section: Transport of Development Objects, in the course BC400 (Unit 2, Lesson 2) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 8, Lesson 2).

## Unit 3

The built-in ABAP standard data types that already contain a type-specific, fixed-length specification are considered complete data types. They are: `D`, `T`, `I`, `INT8`, `F`, `STRING`, `XSTRING`, `DECFLOAT16`, `DECFLOAT34`. Read more in the lesson, Defining Elementary Data Objects, Task: Complete ABAP Standard Data Types, in the course BC400 (Unit 3, Lesson 1) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 9, Lesson 1).

You can formulate negations by placing the `NOT` operator before the logical expression. When negating the `IS INITIAL` query, you can use the special `IS NOT INITIAL` query. Read more in the lesson, Using Basic ABAP Statements, Task: IF Statement, in the course BC400 (Unit 3, Lesson 2) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 9, Lesson 2).

Specify the three-digit message number and the message class when using the `MESSAGE` statement. Use the message type to specify where you want the message to be displayed. Read more in the lesson, Using Basic ABAP Statement, Task: Dialog Messages, in the course BC400 (Unit 3, Lesson 2) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 9, Lesson 2).

In nested loops, sy-index always contains the loop pass number of the loop in which it is located. In the `DO` and `WHILE` loops, the sy-index system field contains the number of the current loop pass. Therefore, you should only query this system field within a loop. Read more in the lesson, Using Basic ABAP Statement, Task: Loop Constructs, in the course BC400 (Unit 3, Lesson 2) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 9, Lesson 2).

To start the debugger from a screen, enter `/h` in the command field, and press Enter. Read more in the lesson, Analyzing Programs with the ABAP Debugger, Task: Debugging Mode at Runtime, in the course BC400 (Unit 3, Lesson 3) or TAW10 Part I (Unit 9, Lesson 3).
